# Tracking vehicle sources using six-component seismic point measurements

This repository contains six-component (6C) seismic recordings generated by moving traffic sources. We use a collocated seismometer and rotational sensor to simultaneously capture both translational and rotational ground motions caused by passing vehicles. Our research introduces a novel method for determining source directionality using a single 6C station.
